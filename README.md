Hello, my name is Nozomu üëã  

I started a new journey into the universe of data by completing my MSc in Data Analytics. Now I‚Äôm building projects to help data find its voice.  

Curious by nature and always optimistic, I love bringing good energy into every room.  

üå± Currently working on a project that explores the relationship between sales and review scores (users and professional critics) ‚Äî testing hypotheses and experimenting with statistical methods.  
üìñ Improving my skills in storytelling and visualization to give data a stronger voice.  
ü§ù Excited to collaborate on projects where data tells meaningful stories.
